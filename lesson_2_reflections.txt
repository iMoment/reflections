What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You allow for a directory to be a git repository, the .git directory will be
created so that tracking the status and log of that repository is possible.
If you don't initialize the repository,it will just exist as a standalone
directory.  It doesn't create a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is the directory that contains all the files that you are
going to edit and make changes to.  The repository will contain a commit of
logical changes.  So the staging area acts as a medium between the two, as a
way of preparing something you worked on to be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Since the staging area acts as a medium between the working directory and the
repository, you can git diff --staged to compare the things you added to the
staging area with your most recent commit.  If the changes seem to be a logical
change, you can commit.

support in editing other useful versions.
