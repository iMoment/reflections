What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You allow for a directory to be a git repository, the .git directory will be
created so that tracking the status and log of that repository is possible.
If you don't initialize the repository,it will just exist as a standalone
directory.  It doesn't create a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is the directory that contains all the files that you are
going to edit and make changes to.  The repository will contain a commit of
logical changes.  So the staging area acts as a medium between the two, as a
way of preparing something you worked on to be committed.

change?
